## Data Sources

This platform is designed to aggregate SALN data from official government channels only. Currently, the system displays a "No data yet" state as we work to establish proper data sourcing partnerships with relevant government agencies.

**Important:** All SALN data will be sourced exclusively from official channels to ensure accuracy and authenticity.

## Design System

The platform features a modern Filipino election website design system:

- **Colors**: Philippine flag colors (Red #F70000, Blue #0038A8, Yellow #FCD116)
- **Typography**: Bold headings with tight tracking, medium weight text
- **Components**: Clean cards with rounded corners, multi-variant buttons, glass effects
- **Layout**: Container-based, responsive grid, mobile-first approach
- **Branding**: Flag-inspired gradients and patriotic color schemes

## Contributing

## Legal Framework

The Statement of Assets, Liabilities, and Net Worth (SALN) is required under Philippine law for all public officials. This platform supports the constitutional right of citizens to access information on matters of public concern.
